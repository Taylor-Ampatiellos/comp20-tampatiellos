Lab: Finalizing Your Learning Portfolio
Creator: Taylor Ampatiellos

1. The purpose of this Git repository, per the name of this last lab, is to exist as a learning portfolio.
   A portfolio that not only showcases what I have learned over the course of Comp20, but can also be a great
   resource for future projects expanding upon said material.
2. My favorite assignment was Assignment 2, creating the front-end for the ride-sharing service. 
   Not only was it one of the more involved assignments, but it was great to work on something that felt so
   close to its real-world counterpart.
3. I think I have grown significantly since day 1, as I knew nothing about web programming before this course.
4. The most important thing that I have learned in this class is responsive design. 
   In this day and age, with so many different internet-capable devices out there, 
   it is important to make sure that all phones/tablets/computers display your 
   content the way you want them to! As far as examples are concerned there is of 
   course the work done for lab 4, but a more complex example is having my team's
   end-of-semester project work on both phones and laptops.
5. Now that I have finished the course, I would love to delve deeper into the server
   side of things. I feel very comfortable with front-end code, and would love to
   have my back-end knowledge grow to match!
