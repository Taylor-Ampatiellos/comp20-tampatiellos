		<h1>Introduction:</h1>
		<p>I was hired to perform a security analysis on a prototype ride-sharing platform created by Ming Chow.
		   This included both penetration testing and a general analysis of site structure/output.</p>

		<h1>Methodology:</h1>
		<p>Considering the simplicity/insecurity of the provided product, I felt it unneccessary to use
		    complex tools, instead opting to use curl, the Chrome browser, and the product's source code 
		    to test for common vulnerabilities.</p>

		<h1>Findings:</h1>
		<p>This product is extremely insecure. Not only is valuable user information stored and displayed
			in a highly visible/accessible manner, but the site itself can be edited by third-parties
			to an alarming extent. These edits can range from mundane annoyances to implementation
			of malicious scripts.</p>

		<h1>Specific Issues Found:</h1>
			<OL>
				<LI>Cross-Site Scripting
					<UL>
						<LI>Location: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/rides
						<LI>Severity: High
						<LI>Description: External scripts can be hard-coded into the site through posting
										 to the /rides API. <br>
										 Although in my testing the scripts I implemented were rather benign (some
										 simple-but-annoying pop-up windows), XSS of this nature
										 can be used maliciously to attack users, 
										 redirect traffic, or even mine Bitcoin for a third-party.
						<LI>Proof: The image below is the result of this single input in Git Bash using curl: <br>	
									curl --data "username=&lt;script> alert('HELP IVE BEEN ABDUCTED BY ALIENS') &lt;/script>&lat=10&lng=10" https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/rides <br>
									<img src="images/abduction.png" alt="Funny Alert Message" width="1200">
						<LI>Resolution: This vulnerability can be easily prevented by sanitizing inputs and ensuring that no
										malicious code is being provided as input.
										Also, although it has not been detailed in this report as a specific issue due to being a "weak" vulnerability, 
										using similar methods as shown above HTML injection can also be performed on 
										the page. These injections can also be prevented using sanitization. <br>
										Example of HTML injection: <br>

					</UL>
				
				<br>
				
				<LI>Database Injection
					<UL>
						<LI>Location: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/vehicle.json
						<LI>Severity: High
						<LI>Description: The most alarming thing about this vulnerability is that it can be
				 							exploited in-browser. Through using certain commands as the 
				 							query in the URL, valuable information stored in the database can
				 							be output to the user. More specifically, by using 'username[$ne]=JANET'
				 							as the query, data is returned to the user for which the username
				 							is NOT 'JANET'. Although in this case only one data entry is returned
				 							at a time, a script could easily be written to access every data entry.
						<LI>Proof: The image below is the result of accessing the URL above using a database injection query: <br>
									https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/vehicle.json?username[$ne]=JANET <br>
									<img src="images/data_inj.png" alt="Database Injection Example" width="1200">
						<LI>Resolution: Once again, this vulnerability can be prevented through sanitizing inputs,
										ensuring that querys do not contain characters/strings used for injection attacks.
					</UL>
				
				<br>
				
				<LI>Bad Programming Practice â€” Displaying User Info
					<UL>
						<LI>Location: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/
						<LI>Severity: Medium
						<LI>Description: Upon visiting the URL above, the user is greeted with a list of
											all passengers in the database in descending order by timestamp.
											While simply displaying usernames would not be an egregious breach
											of valuable user data, also displayed with these usernames
											is the user's location as of their last vehicle request. This data
											is completely unneccesary to share, and could be used maliciously.
						<LI>Proof: The image below is example output from https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/<br>
									<img src="images/list.png" alt="Database Injection Example" width="600">
						<LI>Resolution: Keep this user data private! There is no need to display such valuable 
										information for all to see. The only time a passenger's location should 
										be displayed is when they are requesting a ride, and this information
										should only be given to the single vehicle which will be picking them up.
					</UL>
			</OL>

		<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
		<p>As stated above, this product is extremely insecure. Before continuing to expand this 
		   product's capabilities, the creator should focus on both a restructuring of how data is displayed
		   and an increase in security measures to ensure that internal data is secure and the site itself
		   cannot be injected with scripts.</p>
